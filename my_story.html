    <h1> these are my some of my childhood stories</h1>
    <p>hi my name is avinas sakhardande at the time of making this website i am 10 years old and today i am going to
      tell you my story soo!
    <h1>lets begin</h1>
    so i was born on the 17th of february 2011 in marcel,goa in india. and the first word i said was my grandma's name
    when i was little i loved to draw
    but we did not had paper for me to draw so one day i took a pencil and i scribbled it all over a wall in my house
    but my mom and dad angerd me and then i started doing that in secret but they caught me one day so at that time i
    filled my entire hosue wall's with scribbles or drawing's wich were not very good and at that time i was 4 years
    old.</p>
    <p>so this story begins at the morning of my first day in school i woke up brushed my theeth and the ate some
      breakfast and then i went to my first school and i did not cry but the other children that cried i was wiping ther
      teirs up and saying why are they crying
      and btw this is not a fake story so at this time i was 3 and a half years old</p>
    <p>hi so this story is aboutmy journey in coding ang i learned it from white hat jr so at first i didnt know that
      what is coding but one day i was watching tv and suddenly and came up
      and it said hello this is white hat jr get a trial class now for free so at that time i was a bit lazy so my dad
      told me to register in this at first i said no but on the next day i texted my dad that i want to enroll in it
      then my dad said ok
      but when my dd came home because of a internet glitch it was canceled but my dad trolled me by saying that it
      needed a laptop actually we only had 1 laptop wich was my dad's office laptop and after 6 months i finaly booked a
      coding class it said that you could take only the trial class on tablet or mobile so ya and then i registered in
